## Introduction üåü

GPTStonks is a financial chatbot powered by LLMs and enhanced with the openbb framework. It provides natural language conversation capabilities for financial topics, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of financial applications, including:

- Learning about the financial markets
- Improving trading strategies
- Financial news analysis: sentiment, trends, etc.
- Customer support for financial institutions

This API allows you to integrate the GPTStonks financial chatbot into your projects, enabling real-time financial chat interactions with users.

## Features üöÄ

- **Real-time Financial Chat**: Engage in natural language conversations about financial topics.
- **Customizable Responses**: Tailor the chatbot's responses to suit your specific use case.
- **Easy Integration**: Built on FastAPI, this API is designed for straightforward integration into your application or platform.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation and examples to help you get started quickly.

## Supported LLM Providers

- **[Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)**: optimized implementations of the most popular open source LLMs for inference over CPU and GPU. See their docs for more details on supported models, which include Mixtral, Llama 2 and Zephyr among others. Many quantized models (GGUF) can be found in Hugging Face under the user [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke).
- **[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)**: foundation models from a variety of providers, including Anthropic and Amazon.
- **[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)**: GPT family of foundation models. For now only `instruct` versions are supported, such as `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`. Chat versions will be added soon.
- **[Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)**: similar to Amazon Bedrock but provided by Google. This integration is in alpha version, not recommended for now.

## Supported Embeddings Providers

- **[OpenAI Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/embeddings)**: includes models such as Ada 2.
- **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)**: including providers such as BAAI, see their general embedding (BGE) [model list](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5#model-list).

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your system.

### Full deployment \[api + frontend + db\] (recommended)

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gptstonks/api.git
```

2. Check the `.env.template` file for the required environment variables. Modify the values as desired and save the file.

3. Run the docker-compose file:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

4. If you didn't change any port configuration, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the frontend.

5. (optional) If you want to use your `OpenBB` PAT to access resources, you can set it from the API Keys section (sidebar) in the frontend.

### Installation üõ∏

1. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project directory with the contents specified in `.env.template`.

2. **\[Highly Recommended\] Option 1:** use the latest Docker image in [ghcr.io](https://github.com/features/packages).

```bash
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env ghcr.io/gptstonks/api:main
```

- **Option 2:** build from source.

  1. Install [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/#installation) for a faster install.

  2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/GPTStonks/api.git
  ```

  2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd gptstonks_api
  ```

  3. Install the required dependencies:

  ```bash
  pdm install --no-editable --no-self
  ```

  4. Create `openssl.cnf` to allow legacy TLS renegotiation, needed for OECD data in OpenBB.

  ```bash
  echo 'openssl_conf = openssl_init\n\
  \n\
  [openssl_init]\n\
  ssl_conf = ssl_sect\n\
  \n\
  [ssl_sect]\n\
  system_default = system_default_sect\n\
  \n\
  [system_default_sect]\n\
  Options = UnsafeLegacyRenegotiation'\
  > openssl.cnf
  ```

  5. Start the API:

  ```bash
  uvicorn gptstonks_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
  ```

Now your GPTStonks Financial Chatbot API is up and running!

## For Production Environments üè≠

For production environments, additional steps are necessary to ensure security and stability:

Ensure that uvicorn is configured with SSL certificates for secure HTTPS communication.

Build the Docker image from source:

```bash
docker build -t gptstonks-api:v0.1_pro -f Dockerfile.pro .
```

Now you can run the Docker image with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 443:8000 \
-v /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.gptstonks.net/fullchain.pem:/api/cert.pem \
-v /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.gptstonks.net/privkey.pem:/api/key.pem \
--env-file .env gptstonks-api:v0.1_pro
```

## Usageüí°

To use the GPTStonks Financial Chatbot API, send HTTP requests to the provided endpoints. You can interact with the chatbot by sending messages and receiving responses in real-time.

## API Endpointsüåê

Check `http://localhost:8000/docs` once the API is started to access the endpoints' documentation.
